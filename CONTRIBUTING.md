HkUp welcomes contributions to enhance this CLI application! Before submitting a pull request (PR) for a new feature, please follow these steps:

1. **Create an Issue**:
    If you have an idea for a new feature, please create a new issue in the repository using the **feature_request** template. Provide a clear description of the feature and its potential benefits. Please note that issues submitted without using the template may be closed without warning.

2. **Wait for Approval**:
    Once you submit your issue, I’ll review it and provide feedback. If I approve the feature request, I will let you know that you're free to proceed with your PR.

3. **Submit Your PR**:
    After receiving approval, you can create your PR. Be sure to reference the issue in your PR description.

Please note that PRs submitted without prior approval through an issue may be closed without merging. This process helps us manage feature requests effectively and ensures that contributions align with the project’s goals.
